    <h1>General Information</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever struggled to find routes? Yeah, me too. The search capabilities on MountainProject leave something
      to be desired. Through this interface you can search for routes in a much more natural fashion.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <p>
      Not only can you select routes, but you can also have them recommended to you based on textual similarity of
      climbing keywords, user similarity where routes are recommended to you based off of the routes you have
      previously rated, or item similarity where routes are recommended because users who climbed route X also climbed
      route Y.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <p>
      Note that when interacting with the search and recommendation utilities that the broader your search criteria are,
      the longer it will take to return your results. This is especially true of the user similarity recommender.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <p>
      Finally, when using the recommendation utilities, the only strictly required field is the first one on each page.
      Without that information the recommenders cannot function as it will have nothing to recommend based off of.
